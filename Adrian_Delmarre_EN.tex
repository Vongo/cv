\section{Main side-projects}

\begin{yearlist}

\item{2014}
     {\href{https://github.com/halflings/autonomee}{Autonomee}}
     {With a few classmates, we've built a little robot-car using the power of Arduino, Raspberry Pi and a couple of motors associated with a bunch of sensors. On top of that, we've also built a desktop and a mobile clients able to control the car remotely (with the ability to automatically avoid obstacles), but also simulated a particle filter: an algorithm that makes it possible to determine the position and orientation of the car even though the sensors are noisy.}

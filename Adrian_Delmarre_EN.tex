\item{June 2013 -- September 2013}
     {Systar, Lyon, France}
     {NoSQL Backoffice Java Developer}

Conception and implementation of a RedoLog.
In a NoSQL (column, key-value) bi-temporal database context, the internship objective was to log transactions in a custom binary format, so that we could guarantee platform integrity even after a crash, by replaying transactions in the same exact order.
Skills : Java EE, Concurrency programming, NoSQL, Scrum

\item{January 2012 -- March 2012}
     {Pole Azur Provence, Grasse, France}
     {Product Developer}

I was asked to design and develop, from scratch, a Sharepoint Workflow management tool. This was made possible by the combination of a desktop user interface and a Windows Service. They were both run on the Sharepoint main server, which involved memory and performance management issues.
Skills : Project Management, Sharepoint, C\#, WinService

     {With a few classmates, we've built a little robot-car using the power of Arduino, Raspberry Pi and a couple of motors associated with a bunch of sensors. On top of that, we've also built a desktop and a mobile clients able to control the car remotely (with the ability to automatically avoid obstacles), but also simulated a particle filter: an algorithm that makes it possible to determine the position and orientation of the car even though the sensors are noisy.}

\begin{eventlist}

\item{February 2015 -- Present}
     {Universitat Passau, Passau, Germany}
     {Fraud Detection}
     
The purpose of the project is to evaluate and improve current techniques for detection of payment fraud. This involves high-volume real-time machine learning issues.
Skills : Binary classification, Data balancing, Optimization, R

\item{May 2014 -- September 2014}
     {ANEO, Boulogne-Billancourt, France}
     {Social Network Analyst}
     
By examining interpersonal communications (mainly e-mail) as typed graphs using Social Network Analysis techniques, we got a better understanding of the structure of inner and outer-organizational communication. This helped us improving the way information and change could be brought.
Skills : R, Social Network Analysis, Organizational Network Analysis

\item{June 2013 -- September 2013}
     {Systar, Lyon, France}
     {NoSQL Backoffice Java Developer}
     
Conception and implementation of a RedoLog.
In a NoSQL (column, key-value) bi-temporal database context, the internship objective was to log transactions in a custom binary format, so that we could guarantee platform integrity even after a crash, by replaying transactions in the same exact order.
Skills : Java EE, Concurrency programming, NoSQL, Scrum

\item{January 2012 -- March 2012}
     {Pole Azur Provence, Grasse, France}
     {Product Developer}
     
I was asked to design and develop, from scratch, a Sharepoint Workflow management tool. This was made possible by the combination of a desktop user interface and a Windows Service. They were both run on the Sharepoint main server, which involved memory and performance management issues.
Skills : Project Management, Sharepoint, C\#, WinService

\item{May 2011 -- July 2011}
     {City Hall, Marseille, France}
     {Java EE Developer}
     
The Department of Public Contracts needed a monitoring and management tool. I personally took part in conception meetings with the client, wrote the technical specifications, and eventually developed a few components.
Skills : Java EE, Hibernate, Struts, Tomcat

\begin{yearlist}

\item{2013}
     {\href{https://github.com/halflings/autonomee}{github.com/halflings/autonomee}}
     {With a few classmates, we've built a little robot-car using the power of Arduino, Raspberry Pi and a couple of motors associated with a bunch of sensors. On top of that, we've also built a desktop and a mobile clients able to control the car remotely (with the ability to automatically avoid obstacles), but also simulated a particle filter: an algorithm that makes it possible to determine the position and orientation of the car even though the sensors are noisy.}
